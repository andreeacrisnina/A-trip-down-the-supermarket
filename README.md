# A-trip-down-the-supermarket
A TRIP DOWN THE SUPERMARKET explores perspectives on supermarkets and the temporality of life. It aims to create a  mixture of alternate reality, surrealism and the superfulousness of capitalism, through harmonic and hypnotic audiovisual interraction. This is my final project of the Theoretical Backgrounds of Audio and Graphics course.   ----------------------------------------------------------- Tools: P5.js, Reaper
